1) Create a class named Shape with a function that prints "This is a shape". Create another class named Polygon inheriting the Shape class with the same function that prints "Polygon is a shape". Create two other classes named Rectangle and Triangle having the same function which prints "Rectangle is a polygon" and "Triangle is a polygon" respectively. Again, make another class named Square having the same function which prints "Square is a rectangle". 
Now, try calling the function by the object of each of these classes.

2) Create two classes named Mammals and MarineAnimals. Create another class named BlueWhale which inherits both the above classes. Now, create a function in each of these classes which prints "I am mammal", "I am a marine animal" and "I belong to both the categories: Mammals as well as Marine Animals" respectively. Now, create an object for each of the above class and try calling every function.
